The command "make" in the main directory creates an executable file named "iplot".

To run the program from the main directory, just type "./bin/iplot".

To clean the directory (remove files ending in ~, .o files, executable files and /bin directory), type "make clean".

However, if the program is correctly running, I couldn't display correctly the father and son processes using the "top" command. Maybe it is because the processes don't use enough CPU to be displayed on the screen.
